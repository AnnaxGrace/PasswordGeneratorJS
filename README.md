# PasswordGeneratorJS

Pseudo Code:

Choose a number 8-128


The confirm boxes need to say in the for loop "if this was selected "ok", then use this random.
    - Is this where we would push into the array? I think so!

Then the generator needs to pick randomly from a selection of randoms. So there needs to be 4 strings, then those strings need to be random. And then each character needs to pick randomly from those randoms for the amount of number user picks.
